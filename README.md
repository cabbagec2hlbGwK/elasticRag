4. **In what way is the identification of commercial entities or materials in NIST publications intended to be perceived?**
   - (Lines: "Certain commercial entities, equipment, or materials may be identified in this document in order to describe an experimental procedure or concept adequately. Such identification is not intended to imply recommendation or endorsement by NIST, nor is it intended to imply that the entities, materials, or equipment are necessarily the best available for the purpose.")
   - A. As a recommendation to use these entities or materials as standards.
   - B. As a neutral identification to adequately describe procedures without implying endorsement.
   - C. As the best available options that should be preferred whenever applicable.
   - D. As an indirect endorsement, suggesting their use could be advantageous.

5. **What does the document suggest about the use of NIST Special Publication 800-101r1 by nongovernmental organizations?**
   - (Lines: "This publication may be used by nongovernmental organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright in the United States. Attribution would, however, be appreciated by NIST.")
   - A. Use is discouraged unless mandatory compliance is established.
